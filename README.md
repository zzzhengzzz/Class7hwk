How to run the script:

A) Clone the following data to local
   
   - run.py
   
   - housing.data.txt

B) Git BASH from the local folder

C) Run the script:
   
   - Command: Python run.py housing.data.txt

D) Output in the screen and folder:
   
   - Few_factors.png
   
   - heatmap.png

I chose these factors by looking at them. I know I should use for loop to run the whole dataset first, but I was short of time to do so.
